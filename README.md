# PF1 Automate Damage
Automate Damage is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop (FoundryVTT) designed to enhance and streamline the damage calculation and application process for Pathfinder First Edition (PF1) games.

**WARNING: This module is currently in alpha stage. As my first module ever, I have released it to receive feedback and identify potential issues with the way it handles damage. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated to improve the module.**

## Features

- **Damage Calculation**: The module seamlessly integrates into the FoundryVTT interface and PF1E system. It changes the way damage is applied and calculates damage based on various factors, including resistances, immunities, vulnerabilities, and whether the damage source is a spell or weapon. The module always calculates the damage based on the target's damage reduction, resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities. However, you can always shift-click to apply damage differently as usual with the PF1E system.

## Installation
Manifest URL: https://github.com/Nevela-0/PF1-Automate-Damage/releases/latest/download/module.json

## Usage

Once the module is installed and enabled, it automatically enhances the damage calculation and application process in your PF1 games without requiring any additional configuration. Simply apply damage as usual, and the module will handle the rest.
